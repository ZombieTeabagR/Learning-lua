Teaching myself Lua: So Far I have downloaded the prerequisits for following the Lua online edition to the begginers guide found here: https://www.lua.org/start.html 

I have code block as my compiler registered for github (obviously) and downloaded cmake. Even though I have cblock for a compiler I downloaded mingw to keep with the instructions found on the mentioned webpage.
